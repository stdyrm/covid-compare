## **COVID-19 State Comparison**
When I first created the chart in late March, there weren't many resources comparing states by "cases per capita" or by "days of outbreak". My goal was to create a fair comparison among all the states, so we could better isolate factors in each outbreak.

COVID-19 data has been freely provided by the New York Times.

**There are two charts:** 
1. Line chart - three different parameter choices:
	* Cases/1000 - number of cases per 1000 people in a state population
	* Total cases (log chart) - total number of cases. Log chart is used to better illustrate change in number of cases.
	* New Cases - daily new cases by day of outbreak.
2. Gapminder chart - measures cases vs. deaths for all states over the first 105 days of outbreak ("date" of "day 1" varies by state). There are a number of parameter and filter choices.

- Both charts have filter options to quickly see the outbreak in different regions, populations, etc.
- There are options to save the chart as a PNG file, and "light mode" for a printer-friendly version. WARNING: currently, changing to "light mode" will re-render the chart.

### **Data sources**
1. State COVID-19 data: New York Times
2. State population: U.S. Census Bureau
3. State GDP: Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) 
	*Gross domestic product (GDP) by state: All industry total (Millions of current dollars)

### **License:**
You may freely explore and share these charts, but please credit the source: 
Data is from the New York Times, based on reports from state and local agencies.

### **Notes:**
Day of first case = Day 1. Date of Day 1 may be different for different states. 
Although Washington and California had isolated cases since January, the first case of US community spread was reported on 2/26/20.
Including January would lengthen the days since first case in Washington and California, possibly overstating the effectiveness of their policies.
