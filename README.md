## **COVID-19 State Comparison**
This purpose of this graph is to measure the spread of COVID-19 throughout each state.

### **Graph: COVID-19 US State Comparison**
Comparison of COVID-19 cases in US states, normalized for population and measured over number of days since initial outbreak (from 2/27/20).

*COVID-19 data from The New York Times, based on reports from state and local health agencies.*
*Population data from US Census Bureau (2019).*

#### **Normalized for population:**
Number of cases / state population * 1000
Doesn't currently account for population density

#### **Measured over number of days since first case starting from 2/27/20:**
Day of first case = Day 1. Date of Day 1 may be different for different states. 
Although Washington and California had isolated cases since January, the first case of US community spread was reported on 2/26/20.
Including January would lengthen the days since first case in Washington and California, possibly overstating the effectiveness of their policies.

**To do:**
1. (data) Add additional state data:
    * Geographic region
    * (population) Population density

2. (COVID-19 US State Comparison graph):
    * Geographic region filter
    * Combine filters feature
    * Responsive graph width/mobile-friendly layout
    * Custom filters (save selected) feature
    * Highlight line feature

I am not a health expert or statistician; this is a passion project keeping me busy during isolation.
This is not an official source for COVID-19 data and should not be cited without additional research, but hopefully it helps move the discussion along.
